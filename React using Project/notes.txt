WHAT REACT IS

the library for web and native user interfaces
just a tool that makes writing front end applications easier


THINKING IN REACT
- think what your final product would look like basically it's UI
- break the UI into a component heiarchy
- using js is imperative approach, the step by step approach usually followed in programming
    whlle react is decalrative approach like going to a subway and asking
    the guy for a sandwich instaed of following the steps to make it, you just ask for it



Hereâ€™s how you can use `npm create vite@latest` to create a React project within a specific folder in a larger directory:

1. **Navigate to the parent folder**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the larger folder where you want to create your React project. Use the `cd` command to change directories:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/large/folder
   ```

2. **Run the Vite command**:
   Use the following command to create a new project with Vite:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```
   You will be prompted to name your project. Enter a folder name (e.g., `my-react-project`).

3. **Select a template**:
   After naming the folder, you will be prompted to choose a framework and variant. For a React project:
   - Choose `React`.
   - Select `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` based on your preference.

4. **Navigate to the new folder**:
   Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-project
   ```

5. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the development server**:
   Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access your project**:
   Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Tips
- If you want the project to be directly created inside a specific folder without additional prompts, you can pass the project name and template directly in the command:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest my-react-project --template react
  ```
  This will create a folder named `my-react-project` with the React template set up.

- If your folder is nested inside the bigger folder, you can provide the full path to create the project:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest path/to/bigger/folder/my-react-project --template react
  ```
